        <h2><br>Hope you're having a good birthday so far! 
            Considering that this is our last year in middle school, I wanted to make it a bit special. 
            So after totally tryharding (I mean, of course), I put together a bunch of memories that we shared together and can look back on with joy. </h2>

                        <li>This project was basically the start of the group chat and our friendship all the way back in fifth grade</li>
                        <li>We can pretty safely agree that back then we were young and immature (look at how high-pitched our voices are!!)</li>

                        <li>We also had so much fun at Six Flags, going on giant roller coasters, signing t-shirts, traveling in an incredibly oversized group, and so much more! </li>
                        <li>Let's not forget how Mead completely swept everyone in the Music in the Parks competition (4 FULL TROPHIES) and how rewarding that was!!!!!</li>
